# Jinteki.net Chrome Extention

This is a simple inject of css that you can add to your extensions in chrome that allows you to add a custom image and increases the font on the game stats and game log

### Setup

- In the styles.css file change the background image link to whatever you would like 
- Open chrome and go to the extensions page under more tools 
- Drag jnet-background-extension folder with all the contents into the window
- The lobby image should update to whatever you specified

Note - I've increased the size of the font a little to make it easier for me to see credits and the log. Just delete those section in the css if you don't wnat them.
